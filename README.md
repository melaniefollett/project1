Project Description/Outline

Our project will investigate what factors affect whether a video game is successful or not based on video game ratings and sales for 2009-2019.  First, we will determine if there is a relationship between global sales and critic ratings.  Then we’ll investigate further by determining how global sales and critic ratings vary across video game genres, platforms, and developers.  We’ll also determine if the number of games per year varies across developers and if there’s a relationship with ratings and sales.  Finally, we’ll determine if video game genres differ in their sales vary across different regions.
Using this analysis, we will determine which genre and platform are most likely to result in a successful video game, and whether genre popularity varies with region.  We will also find which developers produce the most successful games and whether the number of games they release per year is related to their success.
